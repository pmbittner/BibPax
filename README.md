## My Publications as BibTeX entries

This repository stores a list of my publication as BibTeX entries including metadata such as links to publications, preprints, videos, slides, and so on.

This requires MYabrv.bib or MYshort.bib from [BibTags](https://github.com/TUBS-ISF/BibTags).
Clone separately.
Maybe I can include a copy here where I verified that the versions match.
